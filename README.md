# Restitution
Full-stack build of record's fragment. Activation executes as agile-type crude-control stockpile approximation management.  
Layman's term: Rough file and directory backlog management.  
Built specifically for VN backlogger in mind.

# Demo
Live demo available at [skyvory.meteor.com] (https://skyvory.meteor.com)  
Occasional error on meteor side is to be expected as of poor availability.

# Installation
1. Install [Meteor] (https://www.meteor.com/install)
2. Run 'meteor' command on application directory
3. If no problem occurs, application will run at designated port (see terminal).

# Usage
## Requirements
App requires registered local account which could be done in the app itself.  

## Control
- Record insertion supports multiple logs, separated by line break, at once.
- Deletion by holding close button on expanded list item

# Todo
- Automatic logs insertion by directory
